Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.<br>
Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.<br>
On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.<br>
If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.<br>
